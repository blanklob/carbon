# Carbon

> The pollution generated by the internet industry and its impact on the climate is equivalent to that of the aviation sector ü§Ø, crazy right..


## Context 

The digital ecological footprint is far from negligible even if it seems insignificant compared to other sectors and it is difficult to believe that one can "pollute" while surfing the Internet and yet this is what happens !

We decided to deal with this problem by focusing on the impact of social networks on the environment and from there, our choice fell on the social network Twitter.

In order to guarantee the best user experience (whether interactive, immersive but also impactful), we have designed and developed a data visualization adapted to our theme.


## Technology 

We made a cross-platform progressive web application that you can install as a desktop or mobile native application, we pay attention to performance, responsive design and security, that's why we created a personalized proxy API to store the access codes to Twitter instead of storing them as in client side.

## Usage

To get started clone the repository, then lunch the development server on the `carbon` folder

```shell
npm run dev
```

Or simply using Yarn (recommended)

```shell
yarn dev
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You'll need to install node dependencies before running the development server.
